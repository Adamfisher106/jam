	<h2>Dietary Help</h2>
	

<div class="text">
<h3>Calcium</h3><br>
<p>Calcium is an essential component for the maintenance of healthy bones, but unfortunately may begin to be reabsorbed back into the body from the bones as we get older. This condition is known as osteoporosis and eventually leads to weakening of the bone tissue which leaves bones brittle and fragile. In order to reduce the risk of osteoporosis and to keep the bones healthy, individuals can obtain calcium from milk and dairy foods such as yogurt and cheese, leafy green vegetables and calcium fortified cereals.<p></div>

<div class="text"><h3>Fat</h3><br><p>Older people who are fit, well and within a healthy weight range should minimise saturated fat intake to improve heart health. However, elderly adults who are above the age of 75 may find that fat restriction is not beneficial, especially if a person is frail, below a healthy weight or has a small appetite. In some cases extra fat may actually be required to increase the number of calories consumed and to aid weight gain. Elderly adults wishing to gain weight should always consult their healthcare provider or a qualified nutritionist before making any significant changes to their diet.</p></div>

<div class="text"><h3>Fibre</h3><br><p>Bowel problems can become an issue as we age and many older and elderly adults do suffer from constipation. In order to keep bowel issues and irritations to a minimum, older adults should include an adequate amount of fibre in their diets as this will help to ensure the digestive system is healthy and in working order. Good sources of fibre include wholegrain cereal, porridge, wholegrain bread, brown pasta and rice, fresh fruit and vegetables and pulses. Also remember to drink plenty of fluids as this will help the gut to function properly.</p></div>

<div class="image"><img src="images/fibre.jpg"></div>


<div class="text"><h3>Fluid</h3><br> <p>As we get older the body's ability to conserve water gradually decreases and the perception of thirst becomes less sensitive. However, dehydration can result in drowsiness and confusion among other side effects so it is important to keep hydrated throughout the day even if we don't feel thirsty. Fluid intake does not necessarily mean just water and can also include hot drinks such as tea and coffee, fruit juice or squash.</p></div>

<div class="text"><h3>Iron</h3><br>
	<p>Iron can be found in meat, some vegetables and dried fruit. The body uses it to make haemoglobin, which helps to store and carry oxygen in the red blood cells from the lungs to the rest of the body. Without iron in the blood, the organs and tissue receive less oxygen than they usually would leading to tiredness and lethargy (this is known as iron deficiency anaemia).</p></div>

<div class="image"><img src="images/iron.jpg"></div>


<div class="text"><h3>Vitamin C</h3><br>
	<p>This vitamin assists the body in its formation of collagen, which is needed to heal wounds and repair bones and teeth. It's also needed to make skin, ligaments, blood vessels and tendons and it's antioxidant properties are thought to help in the prevention of heart disease and cancer. Fresh fruit and vegetables are the main source of vitamin C but supplements can also be taken to keep levels topped up.</p></div>

<div class="image"><img src="images/c.jpg"></div>

<div class="text"><h3>Vitamin D</h3><br>
	<p>Vitamin D helps the body to absorb calcium thus slowing the rate of calcium loss from bones. A key source of Vitamin D is exposure to sunlight, though it is important to supplement your diet with foods which are rich in the nutrient such as oily fish, eggs and certain fortified cereals and spreads. As you get older you may need to introduce a vitamin D supplement to your diet as your body may be unable to process enough from the sunlight and your diet alone. The Department of Health has recommended that people aged 65 and over should take a daily 10 microgram vitamin D supplement.</p></div>

<div class="text"><h3>Zinc</h3><br>
	<p>Zinc is required for the maintenance of a healthy immune system and is most commonly found in meat, shellfish, wholemeal bread and pulses.</p></div>
